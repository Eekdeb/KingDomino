What is Kingdomino?
Kingdomino is a board game that inspired this project. The rules can be found here https://themindcafe.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/Kingdomino.pdf

Basic rules
On your turn, you chose a brick and usually place a brick except the first and last rounds and when not possible to place a brick. 
When all players have chosen a brick you will play the previous brick that you have selected.
This brick needs to be next to the Joker tile "white" or same color.
Crowns give you points. One for each biome connected to the crown cell.

In the config file you can see keybindings and change nr of players. (will be changed in the future)
